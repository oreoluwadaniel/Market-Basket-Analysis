# Market Basket Analysis
## Project Overview
This project leverages market basket analysis and seasonal trend analysis on a retail dataset to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior and product sales trends. The dataset contains transactions from an online retail store, including information about invoices, stock codes, descriptions, quantities, invoice dates, unit prices, customer IDs, and countries.

## Purpose
-To perform market basket analysis to identify frequently bought-together product pairs.
-To analyze seasonal trends for the top-selling products.
-To determine key insights for inventory optimization, product recommendations, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Findings
-Using association rule mining, I identified product pairs frequently bought together with higher lift values, indicating strong associations.
-Found that products like the "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" and "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER" have strong associations with other products, suggesting potential for effective cross-selling and bundling.
-Analyzed monthly sales data for the top 5 selling items to uncover seasonal trends and sales spikes.
-Certain products showed clear sales peaks during specific months, indicating potential for seasonal promotions and inventory adjustments.
